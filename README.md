# AFL1 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
The Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive software application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a university library. It enables students and faculty to manage book and CD borrowings, while allowing librarians to maintain inventory, track transactions, and manage user accounts. The system aims to enhance the efficiency of library operations and provide a seamless experience for its users.

# KEY FEATURES
Here are the key features of the Library Management:
1. User Management:
The system supports multiple user types: students, faculty, and librarians. Each user type has specific roles and permissions, ensuring that the system's functionality is tailored to their needs.
2. Book and CD Management
The LMS manages an inventory of books and CDs, including information on authors, publishers, categories, publication year, ISBN, and more. The system allows librarians to add, update, or remove inventory items as needed.
3. Borrowing and Returning: 
Students and faculty can borrow and return books and CDs through the system. The LMS keeps track of each transaction, including the borrowing date, return date, late fees, and damaged item costs.
4. Fine Management
The system automatically calculates fines for late returns and damaged items. Librarians can adjust fines as needed, and users can view their fines and make payments.
5. Categorization
The LMS supports categorization of books and CDs based on their genre, allowing users to search and filter by category. This feature helps users find items more efficiently.
6. User Registration and Authentication
Users must register to borrow items from the library. The system provides a secure authentication process for users to log in and manage their accounts. Librarians have administrative rights to manage user accounts.
7. Reporting and Analytics
The system generates reports on inventory, transactions, fines, and other key metrics. Librarians can use this information to make data-driven decisions about library management.
8. Librarian Management
The LMS supports multiple levels of librarian roles, such as admins and regular staff. This feature allows librarians to manage transactions, add or remove items from inventory, and oversee system operations.
9. Communication Tools
The system provides a communication channel for librarians to send notices to users, such as overdue book reminders, event notifications, or other important information.
10. Audit Trails
The system maintains an audit trail of all actions taken by users and librarians, providing accountability and traceability. This feature is critical for security and compliance purposes.

# These key features come together to create a robust library management system that enhances efficiency, promotes accountability, and provides a seamless user experience for students, faculty, and librarians alike.
